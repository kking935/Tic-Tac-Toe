This is a simple javascript multiplayer tic tac toe game that also demonstrates how the **minimax algorithm** can be used to create an unbeatable A.I. player.

## Minimax Algorithm

The **minimax algorithm** uses **backtracking** to determine all of the possible outcomes of a given move, and chooses the move that *maximizes* the player's score assuming the opponent will always respond by choosing the move that *minimizes* the player's score.
